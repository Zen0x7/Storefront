```

> You don't need use MySQL or MariaDB as this uses sqlite as default.

### 4. Configure shopify credentials

Open your `.env` file and set the following variables:

```dotenv
SHOPIFY_URL=https://your-store.myshopify.com
SHOPIFY_TOKEN=your_private_access_token
```

>
> 1. Log into your Shopify store
> 2. Go to Apps > Develop apps > Create an app 
> 3. Enter a name and create a new custom app
> 4. Under the Configuration tab, grant the following Admin API scopes:
>    - read_products
>    - read_orders
>    - read_customers
> 5. Save, go to API credentials, and copy the Admin API access token (youâ€™ll only see it once)
